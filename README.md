# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Requirement Analysis detailed blueprint  for a booking management system
# Requirement Analysis â€“ Booking System (Airbnb Clone)

Welcome to the Requirement Analysis documentation for the **Booking System** of our **Airbnb Clone** application.

This document outlines the essential requirements, user stories, and system behaviors that will guide the development of the booking functionality. The purpose of this repository is to provide a clear, structured foundation for implementing a seamless, reliable, and intuitive booking experience for both guests and hosts.

By defining both functional and non-functional requirements, this analysis ensures alignment among stakeholders and serves as a reference throughout the development lifecycle.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, examined, and documented to define what a software system should accomplish, this is the analytical part of the project. It involves understanding what, how, and why certain features are necessary and their functions.

This process includes engaging with clients, users, and other stakeholders to identify a clear understanding on the requirements of the project, which are then categorized as **functional** (what the system does) and **non-functional** (how the system performs under constraints such as usability, performance, security, etc.).

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Foundation for Design & Development**: It sets the groundwork for system architecture and feature implementation, there is a clearly defined scope.
-  **Reduces Rework & Miscommunication**: Clear requirements prevent costly changes during later development stages.
- **Ensures Stakeholder's Alignment**: Keeps developers, designers, and product owners aligned on goals and expectations.
- **Improves Product Quality**: Well-analyzed requirements contribute to building a solution that genuinely meets user needs, leading to customer's satisfaction.

Requirement analysis plays a great role to ensure that expectations of a project are met because there is a clear understanding on the tools for the development of the product, it reduces friction during development and ensures customer satisfaction and alignment with all stakeholders.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase involves several essential activities that ensure the software product meets user expectations and project goals. Below are the five key activities typically involved:

- **Requirement Gathering**
  - This involves collecting information from stakeholders, users, clients, and subject matter experts through interviews, surveys or questionnaries, workshops, observation of end-users in their working environment and conducting document analysis of existing documents and systems to understand current funtionalities and requirements. This helps understand the business objectives and details of the software.
  
- **Requirement Elicitation**
  - Focuses on uncovering the actual needs behind stated requirements, expressed and latent needs are uncovered by engaging users in techniques like brainstorming to uncover ideas, use case development, workshops, and prototyping to enable them to visualise their chioces and refine their requirements.


- **Requirement Documentation**
  - Clearly records the collected requirements in a structured format of the functional and non-functional requirements.
  - User stories are used to describe user's perspective and expections of the functions.
  - Provides a use case diagram to show the interacteration between the users and the system.
    
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Involves examining requirements for completeness, consistency, feasibility, and clarity.
  - May include use of models such as flowcharts, UML diagrams, and wireframes to visualize and validate requirements.
  - Helps in identifying dependencies and technical constraints.

- **Requirement Validation**
  - Ensures the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs.
  - Typically involves reviews, walkthroughs, and formal approval sessions with stakeholders.
  - Helps detect ambiguities, inconsistencies, and missing elements early in the process.

Each of these activities plays a crucial role in delivering a successful software product that is aligned with user expectations and business goals.

## ðŸ“‘ Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are typically divided into two major categories: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Understanding both is essential for designing a robust and user-friendly booking system.

### âœ… Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define the core functions and features that the system must perform. They describe what the system should do.

#### Examples of Functional Requirement:
- Users should be able to search for hotels based on location, price, ratings, and availability.
- Hosts should be able to add, update, or delete hotel listings from the Hotel Management Portal.
- Users should be able to make bookings and receive booking confirmations.
- The system must integrate with third-party payment gateways to handle payments securely.
- Booking history should be viewable by both customers and managers.
- Notifications must be sent to hotel managers when a booking is confirmed.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs its functions. They define system attributes such as performance, reliability, scalability, and usability.

#### Examples of Non-Functional Requirement:
- The booking system must support up to 1 million concurrent users during peak hours.
- Search results should be returned within 2 seconds using Elasticsearch and Redis caching.
- All APIs should have 99.9% uptime and use load balancing for high availability.
- The system must encrypt user data in transit and at rest, complying with data protection standards.
- Booking data older than 6 months should be archived to a Cassandra database to maintain performance.
- CDN (Content Delivery Network) should be used to deliver hotel images quickly across regions.
- The system should be horizontally scalable using microservice architecture.

By clearly identifying and documenting these types of requirements, we ensure a scalable, secure, and user-centered experience throughout the booking lifecycle.

 ## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a part of Unified Modeling Language (UML) used during Requirement Analysis to visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help identify what the system should do from the userâ€™s perspective and define the scope of functionalities in a clear and structured way.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- Clarify the systemâ€™s functionality at a glance.
- Simplify communication between stakeholders, developers, and designers.
- Help in identifying key user interactions early in the development process.
- Serve as the foundation for creating user stories and test cases.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are the predefined conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, or other stakeholders. They act as a benchmark to confirm that a feature or functionality works as expected and meets the intended requirements.

### Why Acceptance Criteria Matter:
- Ensure clarity and shared understanding between developers, testers, and stakeholders.
- Help break down requirements into testable statements.
- Reduces back and forth in feature development.
- Serve as a basis for writing user stories and test cases.

### Example: Acceptance Criteria for Checkout Feature in Booking System

**User Story**: As a customer, I want to securely complete my hotel booking and receive a confirmation after payment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. âœ… The user must be logged in to access the checkout page.
2. âœ… The selected room, dates, and price should be displayed for final review before payment.
3. âœ… The system must integrate with a third-party payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or Paystack).
4. âœ… The payment must be processed securely using HTTPS.
5. âœ… The system should display a success message and booking confirmation after successful payment.
6. âœ… A booking confirmation email must be sent to the user with booking details.
7. âœ… If the payment fails, the user must receive an appropriate error message and be redirected back to the checkout page.

By defining clear Acceptance Criteria, teams can better ensure the feature works as intended and satisfies both user needs and business goals.
